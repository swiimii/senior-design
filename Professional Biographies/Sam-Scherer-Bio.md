## Project Sought
I have a lot of interest in game development using Unity and C#. I've been developing games
as a hobby for around 4 years now, and would like to use Senior Design as an opportunity to develop those skills
further, if possible. I'd be most interested in a rigorous Unity project which involves VR or multiplayer/networking.
I do also have skills in C++ and Python, with some interest in AI, so those are some other project topics which I'd
be happy to explore.
