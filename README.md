## Project Abstract
For our Senior Design project, our team is making a online-multiplayer co-op game! Our game takes place aboard a spaceship, on which players will have to stabilize, repair, and reset the course of their vessel before their time runs out! The crew of the spaceship is on a mission to bring important cargo to Earth, the results of which could make the difference in Humanity’s fight for survival! However, space is dangerous, and players will have to protect their ship and themselves from any nearby threats, such as asteroids or aliens!

While completing their objectives, players need to avoid on-ship hazards! With how much time the players have been in cryosleep, there’s rooms with no oxygen, electrical issues, and more that must be repaired before the crew can return home, and players who do so carelessly may end up respawning and losing their items!
Some puzzles also require team effort! Players may have bypass security using twin keys, help allies operate space tech, and more! 

## Additional/Technical Project Description
### Features
Our game, tentatively titled *Space Crisis Escape*, will allow up to 4 networked players to work together to repair their ship. Players will be able to explore their 2D environment, using items found around their ship to solve puzzles. 

### Technology Stack
The game is made using Unity/C#, and is currently in early development (as of Dec. 1, 2021). Any additional software will be acquired from the Unity Asset Store, imported to the project repository as a Git Submodule, or referenced in our appendix.

### Networking Details
Our game will use a Client/Server network architecture, where the "Host" of the game will act as a server and client simultaneously, and other players will all act as clients.

## Budget 
To date, our project has not had any expenses, however we've been discussing the use of senior design funds to afford a Steam Developer license, or art asset licences.
