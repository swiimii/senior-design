## Project Abstract
For our Senior Design project, our team is making a online-multiplayer co-op game! Our game takes place aboard a spaceship, on which players will have to stabilize, repair, and reset the course of their vessel before their time runs out! The crew of the spaceship is on a mission to bring important cargo to Earth, the results of which could make the difference in Humanity’s fight for survival! However, space is dangerous, and players will have to protect their ship and themselves from any nearby threats, such as asteroids or aliens!
While completing their objectives, players need to avoid on-ship hazards! With how much time the players have been in cryosleep, there’s rooms with no oxygen, electrical issues, and more that must be repaired before the crew can return home, and players who do so carelessly may end up respawning and losing their items!
Some puzzles also require team effort! Players may have bypass security using twin keys, help allies operate space tech, and more!
