## Project Abstract
For our Senior Design project, our team has made an online-multiplayer co-op game, using Unity and the Netcode for Gameobjects library! Our game takes place aboard a scuttled spaceship, which players will have to escape to ensure their survival by finding key items and solving puzzles! While completing their objectives, players need to avoid on-ship hazards! Those who fail to do so will end up respawning and losing their items!

## Additional/Technical Project Description
### Features
Our game, *Space Crisis Escape*, allows networked players to work together to escape their ship. Players will be able to explore their 2D environment, using items found around their ship to solve puzzles. 

### Technology Stack
The game is made using Unity/C#, and frequently implements the Netcode for Gameobjects library.

### Networking Details
Our game uses a Client/Server network architecture, where the "Host" of the game will act as a server and client simultaneously, and other players will all act as clients.
