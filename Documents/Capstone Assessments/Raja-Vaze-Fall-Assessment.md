## Introduction
For the Senior Design project, our team has decided to create a 2D multiplayer Escape Room game using Unity and its multiplayer API. The game will be made using a variety of 2D assets, some that will be personally designed and others which can be used license free found online. The game will also be multiplayer so that people can play it together along with their friends. 

## Experience
Most of my experience of Unity and C# comes from the second Co-op at Balluff Inc. While I worked at this company, I was primarily involved with making a virtual reality application for the Microsoft HoloLens using Unity. This application was meant to assist the marketing team to show off the capabilities of their automation products. I had to learn a lot from scratch, so I became very experienced with hitting deadlines and digesting a lot of new knowledge and ideas. I had to implement networked information, modeling, and UI design so that the experience for the marketing team would fit the feel of the companies products.

Some other experience which comes in handy for Unity comes primarily from taking Linear Algebra. Much of coding visual tools and games involves dealing with Vectors of various degrees. If you do not know how to do operations on vectors and how they impact the math, then coding in Unity will not be possible.

I think all of this experience will be very valuable in completing this senior design project.

## Approach / Motivation
Sam and I first met in one of the shared classes we took. We both learned that we were both experienced in Unity so we decided to team-up and make a game for our senior design project. As I had a wide experience in Unity already, I was interested in adding and expanding upon code that I had written for previous projects and implementing a 2D game. Sam was mostly interested in creating a multiplayer networked game. In the interest of combining our two goals, we decided to create a 2D multiplayer Escape Room game which would implement both of our interests. 

My hope is that I can expand upon knowledge I've already gained from work and learn and gain new knowledge in the process of making this game. I also hope that I can learn new ways to work within a team as most of the co-op experience I've had involved working alone.
