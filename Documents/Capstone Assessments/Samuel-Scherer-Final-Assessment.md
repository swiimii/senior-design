# Samuel Scherer Final Assessment - Apr-15-2022

In assessing my contributions for our project Space Crisis Escape, I am confident that my efforts were pivotal to the project’s success. I contributed a large amount of code to this project. Additionally I provisioned most non-code assets used in the final release, and ensured those assets were properly cited if necessary. Lastly, I maintained our project’s GitHub repository, adding GitHub Action Workflows which automatically created builds for our project on multiple platforms. 

In creating a Unity Project with a helpful GitHub Actions pipeline I was able to apply my pre-existing skills which I’ve honed as I’ve studied Computer Science. In creating a multiplayer project with MLAPI, I was able to build a skill in using said library. Despite obstacles we ran into during development, such as issues with the newly available MLAPI library and issues with scheduling conflicts, we’ve successfully created a project with a high level of polish which was admired and complemented by many visitors at the EECS Expo.
