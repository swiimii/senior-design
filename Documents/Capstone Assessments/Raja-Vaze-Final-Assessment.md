# Raja Vaze - Final Assessment

Looking over the work that was done for this project over the past 8 months, I'm confident that I accomplished, learned and contributed a lot to the completion of this project. In the first half of the projects run, I worked mostly on player movement, animation and collision. I updated and improved upon code that I had written, and research that I had done previously in other co-op projects. In the final stretch, I implemented most of the QoE improvements to the UI, such as implementing a proper color scheme and fonts that fits the theme and look of the game. I also spent many hours looking into bug fixes involving synchronizing player animations and movement across the network.

Despite some issues that arose with the MLAPI multiplayer library and some issues with scheduling and syncing up work that we had done, I believe we've ended up with a respectable game that anyone can play and enjoy, while also leaving lots of room to improve and expand upon in the future if desired.
