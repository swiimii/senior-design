## Project Sought
As my second Co-op involved using Unity, and developing virtual reality, I've gained a lot of experience in making games and coding with C#. Due to this experience I also started voluntarily as a hobby participating in various game jams with friends and developing these skills even further.

For my project I'd like to hone these skills even further and develop another project using Unity and C#.
