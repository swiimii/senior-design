# Justification
In the first semester, I spent a majority of the time for the senior design, relearning player movement and animation. I researched, read and watched many videos in creating a smooth, easy and code-clean way to implement player movement and animation. 

For the second semester, I worked primarily on fixing some of the bugs that had arisen in the player movement. One bug fix related to the collisions for the player. Other bugs involved the animation methods used which required both team members to fix. The biggest time sink involved the synchronization of animations and movement over the network. As this was the main aspect which the other team member worked on, I researched and tested many fixes involving the MLAPI documentation. Finally, as the other team member was working on implementing map features and final touches, I worked on implementing a UI that features the theme of the game and is simple enough to use for the typical user.
