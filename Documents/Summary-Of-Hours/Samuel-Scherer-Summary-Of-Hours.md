# Justification
During Fall 2021, I spent most of time for senior design working on ensuring that players would be able to connect to a game lobby, click "Start", and be placed into a game with their teammates. Having no experience using Netcode for Gameobjects at the start of the semester made this difficult at times, especially when running into errors or bugs which hadn't been documented yet.

When I was happy with the state of the Lobby Menu system, I worked on implmementing a class for Hazards in the map, which caused players to be knocked back away from that hazard, which took around 10 hours to implement. Aside from documentation, this is all of the work I completed in Fall 2021 for Senior Design.

During Spring 2022, I spent a majority of my time implementing player and inventory synchronization. This includes ensuring the player's animations synced over the network, and ensuring the player's actions, such as disabling hazards, equipping items, and completing objectives, synced over the network. After that, much of my time was spent on non-technical project features, including Map design + implementation, and creating / acquiring art assets. I also spent several hours polishing the menus, adding QoL changes like auto-filling previously used player names and previously-connected-to IP addresses. Also, in addition to the documentation required by all team members, I spent a large amount of time creating the EECS Expo documentation, including the Poster, Slides, and Video.
